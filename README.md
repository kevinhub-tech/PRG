### Project description

This academic project was my first ever introduction to Java Programming and I got immediately intrigued by Java. The project was given about creating a program where students can answer multiple choice questions and the program will retrieve the correct answers and the total score. This project targeted students to be able to understand how algorithms in Java Programming works. The project requirements were 

1. Create A multiple choice questions program relating to programming languages such as "Java", ".Net" etc. 
2. Design an entire application by impling user's inputs
3. Build algorithms to operate relationship between questions and answers

All of thses functions required to be included in the project and it was all accomplished by using <b> Java Classes and Methods </b>

### What I Have Done

Firstly, it was my first ever experience with Java and other related content about programming has to be learnt for my project. These are things that I have assembled into the project.

- Created CSV files for displaying questions on the application with Microsoft Excel
- Implemented the flow chart and algorithms of MCQ (Multiple choice question) program.
- Developed the program accordingly to the implemented process of flow chart and the CSV files with IntelliJ IDE

### Accomplishment

During the process of the project, there were a lot of concepts that needs to be comprehended, following the development of a Java program. So, these are few thing that I have learnt, correlating to the project.

1. Different type of programming
    - Procedural Programming 
    - Object-oriented programming
    - Event-driven programming

2. Different components in Java
    - Class
    - Method
    - Object etc.

And the program was developed, mainly applying **Procedural Programming** as it is integrated with algorithms.

After solving algorithms and creating questions for the program, it has been implemented with Java and these are the results.
